# About me

I came to this field in early 2016. I first found the word "blockchain"
when I came across to the whitepaper of a platform called ["enigma"](http://www.enigma.co/)
when I was working as an data scientist in Tokyo.

My first reaction to the result of googling the word "blockchain" was
"what? bitcoin? didn't that thing collapsed last year or so?
I thought the president of bitcoin has been arrested."
and I dive down reading whitepaper, bitcointalk and so on, as every bitcoiner do, to the Andreas Antonopoulos called four years journey.

Among many Bitcoin-wizard's words. words from [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin) was most attracting.
